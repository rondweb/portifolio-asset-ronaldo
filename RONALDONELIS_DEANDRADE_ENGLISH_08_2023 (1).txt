Analyst Developer
Desjardins Quebec

As a developer at Desjardins, I was involved in giving support on 
the development of the IBM Lotus applications that were used by 
the bank to manage its operations and services. IBM Lotus is a 
suite of software products that includes Lotus Notes, Lotus 
Domino, Lotus Sametime, Lotus Quick, and Lotus Symphony. 
These products provide features such as email, calendar, 
collaboration, document management, web conferencing, and 
office productivity.

My role was to cover problems of the cybersecurity related to the 
IBM Lotus applications. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting 
systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks that aim to 
access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money 
from users, or interrupt normal business processes. Some of the 
problems that I encountered and solved were:

Unauthorized access: This problem occurs when someone 
gains access to the IBM Lotus applications without proper 
authorization or permission. This can compromise the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and 
services. To prevent this problem, I implemented security 
measures such as encryption, authentication, authorization, 
and auditing. Encryption is the process of transforming 
data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted 
by authorized parties. Authentication is the process of 
verifying the identity of a user or device. Authorization is 
the process of granting or denying access rights to a user 
or device. Auditing is the process of recording and 
reviewing the activities and events that occur on the IBM 
Lotus applications.

Data breach: This problem occurs when sensitive or 
confidential data is leaked or exposed to unauthorized 
parties. Data breach can result in financial loss, 
reputational damage, legal liability, or regulatory penalties 
for the bank and its customers. To prevent this problem, I 
followed the data protection policies and procedures of 
Desjardins and ensured that the IBM Lotus applications 
complied with them. I also used data masking techniques 
to hide or replace sensitive data with fictitious data when 
transferring or storing it outside the IBM Lotus 
applications.

Analyst Developer
Ministry of Justice of Quebec

As a developer at the Ministry of Justice of Quebec, I was 
involved in developing and maintaining the internal systems of 
the ministry. The Ministry of Justice of Quebec is the department 
of the government of Quebec that is responsible for the 
administration of justice, public security, access to information, 
and consumer protection in the province. The internal systems 
that I worked on were designed to support the functions and 
operations of the ministry and its various branches and agencies.

My role was to give support for ancient features and create new 
ones for the internal systems. Ancient features are the features 
that were developed using older technologies or methodologies 
and are no longer compatible or efficient with the current 
standards or requirements. New features are the features that 
were developed using newer technologies or methodologies and 
are more compatible or efficient with the current standards or 
requirements. Some of the tasks that I performed were:

Supporting ancient features: This task involved fixing bugs, 
resolving issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring 
security of the ancient features. Bugs are errors or defects 
in the code that cause unexpected or incorrect results. 
Issues are problems or difficulties that affect the 
functionality or usability of the features. Performance is the 
measure of how fast or responsive the features are. 
Security is the measure of how well the features protect 
the data and services from unauthorized access or attacks. 
To perform this task, I used to debug tools, testing tools, 
monitoring tools, and security tools to identify and resolve 
the bugs, issues, performance problems, and security risks 
of the ancient features.

Creating new features: This task involved designing, 
developing, testing, and deploying new features for the 
internal systems. Designing is the process of planning and 
defining the structure and components of the features. 
Developing is the process of writing and implementing the 
code that executes the features. Testing is the process of 
verifying and validating the functionality and quality of the 
features.

January 2018 - December 2018
Data Scientist
Agronow Agritech - Brazil

As a Data Scientist at Agritech Agronow, I was involved in 
developing a web system based on satellite images to estimate 
agricultural production. Agritech Agronow is a company that 
provides solutions for the agribusiness sector using remote 
sensing and data analysis. The web system that I worked on was 
designed to provide accurate and timely information on the 
current and future agricultural production of various crops and 
regions.

My main role was to develop the data classification algorithms 
using Python, SciPy, and NumPy. Data classification is the process 
of assigning labels or categories to data based on their features or 
patterns. I used satellite imagery from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 as 
the main source of data for estimating agricultural production. 
Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 are Earth observation satellites that 
capture high-resolution images of the land surface in various 
spectral bands. These images can be used to monitor vegetation 
health, crop growth, soil moisture, land use, and land cover.

I used Python as the programming language for developing the 
data classification algorithms. I used SciPy as the framework for 
implementing the data classification algorithms. I used NumPy as 
the library for numerical computation and array manipulation.

I used two types of data classification algorithms: supervised and 
unsupervised. Supervised classification is a type of machine 
learning that assigns labels to data based on predefined classes or 
categories, such as crop type, crop stage, or crop yield. 
Unsupervised classification is a type of machine learning that 
groups data based on their similarities or patterns, such as spectral 
signatures, spatial features, or temporal trends.

For supervised classification, I used algorithms such as k-nearest 
neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM). These 
algorithms learn from labeled training data and then predict labels 
for new data based on their features or distances.
For unsupervised classification, I used algorithms such as k-means 
clustering (KMC). This algorithm discover clusters or components 
of data based on their variance or independence.

As a GIS Developer at the Institute of Research Aerospatial in 
Brazil pas team member of the program of investments in actions 
of prevention, monitoring and combating deforestation, and 
promoting conservation and sustainable use of the Amazon 
Legal, I was involved in developing a web-based fire monitoring 
system for Brazilian forests. INPE is a public institution that 
conducts research and development in the fields of aerospace 
science and technology. The web-based fire monitoring system 
that I worked on was designed to provide timely and accurate 
information on the location, extent, and severity of forest fires in 
AMAZONIA.

I used satellite imagery from Landsat 8 as the main source of 
data for detecting and mapping forest fires using these images of 
the land surface in various spectral bands. These images can be 
used to monitor vegetation health, land use, land cover, and fire 
activity.

I used Python 2.7 as the programming language for developing 
the web-based fire monitoring system using many libraries.

I used Django 1.9 as the web framework for developing the web-
based fire monitoring system to provide features such as object-
relational mapping, template engine, authentication system, URL 
routing, and admin interface.

I used PostgresSQL (PostGIS) as the database for storing and 
retrieving spatial data and PostGIS an extension of PostgresSQL 
that adds support for geographic objects and spatial functions.

I used Python Pandas, NumPy, and Ipython Notebook as the 
tools for data manipulation and analysis working with tabular and 
multidimensional data. 

I used Ipython Notebook to create and share documents that 
contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

I used R and RStudio as the tools for statistical computing and 
graphics such as linear and nonlinear modeling, classical 
statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and 
more.

I used GeoServer and MapServer as the tools for publishing and 
serving spatial data over the web using multiple files such as 
shapefiles, databases, raster files and KML.
